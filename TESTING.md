# TESTING

## Manual Testing

Testing was done throughout site development, for each feature before it was merged into the master file.

Usability was tested with the below user acceptance testing to ensure testing from different users, on different devices and browsers to ensure issues were caught and where possible fixed during development. However, it was noticed that in Chinese browsers (Breeno, QQ, etc) there was some difficulty with the testing, as the browser would not be able to display React components correctly.
