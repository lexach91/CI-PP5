## Web Marketing

1. facebook
Having a page on facebook is a great way to get people to join the meeting on Dr.Meetings. Facebook has millions of users and is a great way to get people to become members of the Dr.Meetings community, it may easily lure new customers and increase the number of members who are purchasing the subscription plans.

[Facebook mockup](documentation/design/dr_meeting_fb.pdf)

2. Newsletter

The newsletter subscription is a great way to deliver the latest news and updates to the users and subscribers.

---

## Future Development
​
1. Add chat functionality;
​
Chat functionality is essential for the future development of the application as it will help users to communicate with each other if there are any issues with the Internet connection or if there is a language barrier between the users.
​
2. Remove person from the meeting;
​
This feature will be added in the future development of the application as the meeting creator will definitely want to control the people who are in the meeting.
​
3. Organization functionality;
​
It would be nice to widen the scope of the application to include functionality for organizations to register and arrange their own private meetings.
